        <p>Starting from Karlsruhe, it is equally 8 hours’ drive to a sea, in the north, in the south, or in the west. Different seas may have different characters on their own, attracting probably again to distinct characters among my colleagues. When I inquired 3 people for their favourite piece of the deep blue, back-propagated are 3 distinct answers. Well for us, yet again, we have packed our luggages again and headed south to the riviera, Italian and French ones.</p>

<p>Southwards beyond Karlsruhe, there is always the Alps to get over with. Young in terms of geological age, the mountain ranges extend itself almost without a single easy passage. Some decades ago, human saw this irritating and inconvenient, so they made one, with calculated, but also quite primal brute force. Travelling through Gotthard Pass via the heart of the mountains several rounds, we are literally getting over with it this time. High altitude grasslands, check! Curious looking cattles, check! Paved roads, check! And cobbled plus a little bit of gravel roads, check! Also please tell me about the views of the valley and bridges hanging so that the two tarmacs running parallel at different altitudes could miraculously join mid-air. Not necessarily topologically a Mobius band, yet it really drives like one as it is hard to believe such looking road so twisted keeps you on the right side where gravity always points downwards.</p>

<p>Also from here it is so high that from the winds you almost smell the sea.</p>

<p>There is the riviera, referred to almost ubiquitously as the French one. However from Genoa onwards one also finds a nicely decorated coastline stretching to the east, namely the Italian riviera. Risen from steams, the Englishmen have walked onto central stage and suddenly got themselves wealthy and educated, and interested for stuff off the rock. Grand tourers find their ways to the fishery villages and bankers’ towns, and perpetually changed the riviera. Later divided into two parts, the French and the Italian, one of rivieras got better recognition, say, from the likes of royal families and ever since prevailed in the competition of tourism attraction to this day. Coastal forts and fishermen have to give way to glamorous hotels and the casino city-state. Same applies also inthe oriental world, to Goa, Macau, Singapore and Hong Kong, well, plus probably also colonism.</p>

<p>In these brand-new towns of marble one finds now poshly suited businessmen and businesswomen, and all sorts of shiny stuff imaginable on the models, on the French side of the riviera, where people in tanned skin tone and sunglasses speak all kinds of languages. Armanda of yachts occupies harbours, declaring their presence with the shear sizes belittling the humble class of people even from miles away. However in towns the local lot seem a little bit less as posh. We arrived at Antibes on the Bastille Day, when a grove of emotion of ectasy has already been touchable. All things mundane exhibit themselves without reservation as everyone prepares to witness the best news in years to broadcast from the television. Bars welcome gathering for the live for the grand finale of the World Cup and reminds people of discounts if they place the orders on the penultimate day, and absolutely no soul cared about people on the yachts who gambles on the football match for pride or fun, as this should be and indeed is exactly the day working class, the beer doped crowd, and also national flag waving, and disgraceful chanting drunkards, own the town.</p>

<p>I remember ordering pizza from a food stand and could not decide between something Napoleon and Riviera some-other-thing-glamorous, before giving up and asked for any pizza with meat along with another with vegetables. The cook was astonished and went “Ah non, what’s the point with no meat? No meat means no tasty pizza.” That is, mundane people yet so honest and so adorable.</p>

<p>On the other direction from which the sun rises, Italian riviera is not as shiny nor celebrated as the French one, with the Italian national football team sitting at home watch the games than playing in the field. From Genoa to Tuscany, this side of the riviera used to sell life styles with the best public relation people writing about them, i.e., from Lord Byron. Not so long ago Ferrari tried once more to capture people’s imagination of such points by renaming their “entry level” sports car from California to Portofino. Well, I wish it were helpful to strengthen sales number in the largest market of Ferrari across the Atlantic Ocean. Meanwhile, mind guessing how many tourists from the US and China flock to Cinque Terre?</p>

<p>All souls, most remarkably recognized as being Chinese, US, or German, seem to enjoy the life style offered by Cinque Terre. Scattered along the coastal natural park, each concave in the hills offers space for a miniature harbour, and gaze deeper into the inlet you find colorful homes in LEGO form expanding each of these harbour areas. Difficult terrain prevents our approaching directly by car to Manarola however the drive starting from Levanto is so bellissimo. From time to time the sea flashes into our eyes as we a gifted a bird view overlooking to the ocean: it seems as if one could open the window and have a dip of the finger tip into the blue, but still the sea is being patient and kept her distance. Even after having taken million turns to get closer, the same peaceful water still smiles, reclined, out of reach from a stone’s throw away.</p>

<p>On and on the road stretches, very scarcely a road sign pops out and a branching of road finds itself winding to one of these villages which is not exactly the destination. Time is lost, insulating us in a capsule, with little gasps heard only between us as every one of the blind turns is taken with into appearance of another. Satnav does not tell our whereabouts but rotated randomly. From the outside it must be a cinematic a sole driver kicks up dirt along the hillside overlooking the azure blue, it might actually work for advertisements of the car. We have all the scenery to ourselves and practically got lost in one of the most poetic frames imaginable.
Yet there started complaining from our stomachs.</p>

<p>In a tight place in between pieces of rocks commuting should become an issue, but as we have later learnt, it has been really good we have to park the car elsewhere and take the train back into the wonderland, seeing everything from closer to the waterside. Here the magnificent sounds of the wave clashing with the breakwater echoes all along the tunnel which the train travels through, while the downside becomes clear that from within the tunnels there is nothing much to see. Weariness from the roadtrip start to take the toll and distracts, but in a split second, a whole piece of color so blue intrudes from the eyes trickles down into the heart, percolating to every neuron on as far as the toe-tips, and refreshes. Pupils contract from the blue flash, before relaxing again in the immediate darkness in the tunnel, but eyes are getting even more wide-open and gaze is fixed to the window, the whole nerve system ready for the next drop of azure.</p>

<p>Walking along the footpaths threading through the villages, it does not take long before the path ends up in a small harbour not nominally larger than a swimming pool, plus sometimes a small stretch of sands. Densely populated by tourists the village center offers a variety of shops, foods, and ice creams - quite an essential in the blazing Italian summer, while between the villages few would take on for an arduous hike.</p>

<p>另一种交通方式么，则是划艇。此时船上就只有俩人了，清净、亲切而完全贴近海水——事实上在sit-on-top的划艇上面，因为舱室没有盖子，海水被船桨带起，会搞得全身都是，水晾干之后，身上则是大块的盐，舔一舔咸的不行。彼时我们还没有自己的划艇，之前“研究“过不少视频教程，进行了充分的心理建设（默念万一落水了不要慌张），也在Schluchsee上演练过两把，在这里可是真的第一次在开放水面上划船。之后我们带着自己的划艇去过不少次博登湖，水面开阔与海中多少相似，也会有不少波浪，但是湖上终究比起海上水深差别很大，浪涌程度不同。说起来，划艇其实是人类最原始的交通工具之一，和最简单的独木舟在结构和功能上都基本相仿。据说从东南亚出发，人们最初就用介于独木舟和划艇之间的简易船只逐岛扩张，桨迹几乎划遍了南太平洋。没有精确导航，没有地图，很难想象什么样的好奇心能让人跨过一大片水，到地球另一头去瞧瞧。较为现代一些的划艇主要以北冰洋上木头皮革结合的样本发展而来，有了轻便结实的框架和柔软又坚韧的船体，制造和维护修理划艇就变得容易多了，哪怕中途漏水，皮革表层也很好修补。前些年靠着现代导航，通讯，地图，有计划的训练和特制的船，一伙志愿者能几十天从美国划一条大些的船从美国西岸到夏威夷再到澳大利亚，还能有空搞些宣传活动，补充采访场务，最后一堆录像素材剪辑成纪录片在Netflix上面播出还能吹捧一番，确实让人看得心潮澎湃，觉得自己什么时候也该行此壮举，才有得纪念，没有虚度时光似的——还可以拿来向他人邀功。可除去专门为了挑战而践行的所谓英雄事迹，我们其实并不需要再多一种把人从A运到B的慢吞吞的水上交通工具，挑战本身自我感动的成分似乎也多了一些，毕竟提前看天气预报选最好的时节按最理想的路线泛舟比起古人来说简直就是作弊——这和雇佣夏尔巴人上上下下给不同高度的几个前进营地的帐篷里面备好食物水燃料和氧气铺好被窝，然后听向导报告说现在天气好赶快上山，就匆匆系着人家给拉好的绳子勇攀珠穆朗玛峰一样，“壮举”实在是打了不少折扣。不折腾折腾怕过得无聊，要折腾一番又有畏难情绪，不敢直面外界的挑战，或直面而挑战自己，也成了一堆中产人士的好笑病症：一部讽刺的电影comme un avion对着这种自我迷醉的“伟大壮举”中最俗气的一部分开刀抨击，前半段还在艾克絮佩里雄心壮志磨刀霍霍要突破束缚，后半段画风突变破罐破摔糊弄了事，和主题歌comme un avion sans aile —— 没翅膀的飞机字面义一样，落得一个尴尬结局让人啼笑皆非。</p>

<p>可那不过都是些凡俗之事，此时此地，从A到A，不过“纵一韦之所如，凌万顷之茫然”。</p>

<p>远远的，岸上小小人型扭转的自拍角度和面孔的像素数还不及桨下波纹看得真切，人声开始混合成无法分辨且无关紧要的一团；离岸稍远，海鸥也不常在此觅食了，只剩下海水轻抚船舷的声音。伴随着波浪形状上下起伏整个划艇拍打，黏滞，与海水融为一体。伸手过去，波浪就从指间流过。按理说海水愈深，洋面的变化愈为多端，波浪的波长也有相应的变化，而较少受到海底或海岸形状的约束。本科大概一年级或二年级的时候几个中学同学在北海公园泛舟，还记得一伙人要详细辩驳起表面波机制的种种，长颈鹿先生此时托着相机拍照，发现等风浪起的时候，无论如何仔细调整，也总是很难把取景器端平，斗争了半天之后才意识到在流动混沌的基础上强求秩序，大抵是徒劳的。海浪轻柔，却无时无刻不是善变的，追马车的高斯，写几个方程算出来呼吸子，万千知识和思绪在具体的问题上并不能做出什么指导。书里的世界究竟不细究水的清冽，也可以忽略了划水形成细密的纹理，更没法详细描述种种细节：指尖和一簇簇汗毛把水的触感和形状告知大脑，舌尖一样能感受到海水，不过此刻苦涩是要咧嘴才能表达的，至于多苦，看嘴咧得多大就好判断。大脑里混合了习得的经验和抽象知识，该是集大成者，但是脑本身又很容易被欺骗：无论从广告纸上还是真正的海里，只要蔚蓝的颜色进入视觉，脑中处理得到的结论就总是畅快解渴的水，苦涩的印象被嵌在动画片、昆虫和和电影的怪兽形象，一遍又一遍暗地里被加强的却是黏黏的绿色。</p>

<p>抽象本身虽美，但并不是没有代价。同事们偶尔谈起机器学习与人脑竞争如何如何，感慨于抽象的力量，又无法忽视信息压缩时失真带来的隐患，如果人脑也没法明白建立起逻辑系统的话，恐惧人工智能在普适认知与思辨上超越人类，似乎就站不住脚，比如靠Instagram之类影集训练出来的美颜手机相机卖到非洲去并不适用，还恨不得歧视人家是猩猩，就只能怪训练神经网络的时候，假定丰富全面而不含偏差的数据本身就是歧视的始作俑者。目前机器的感官还是人为设计的，让这样专用系统根据有限经验去讲述未曾听闻的故事，大抵讲出来也只有一堆信息碎片，讲得愈多差池也愈大，如同此刻飞溅的浪花抛向了天边。</p>

<p>拥抱着我们的，是星球本身的呼吸韵律，这神秘多变又流动的实体，除却几条帆船点缀其间，便是无垠。我们四面被波浪环绕，飘荡在摇篮里，捧一把海水，捞起来的一点点透明流体瞬时祛魅，变得好似再普通不过。仙女变成雕像，月亮变成石头，水不就是氢和氧，能自发少量电解出一定的质子，称称重量我甚至能告诉你有多少个水分子捧在手里，如果愿意的话，还可以给他们每个分子都起好名字，可是水在乎这些么？海洋依旧是海洋。</p>

<p>掳走或交还这捧水，<br />
她的颜色却没有减少半分，<br />
蓝得不可触碰。</p>
