        <div><h1 style="display: inline"> Time halts here in Elba, Italy.</h1> <p style="display:inline"> Anxiety, purpose, or the feeling of existence matters as much as the eternal sky, the continous movement of the clouds, or the rhythm from the ocean. As much as, the void. We came at a silent season. Hiking for an entire day, we'd run into 3 humans, several pine cones, a squirrel, and probably something that resembles a raccoon.</p></div>

<p>Everything is floating here. It may due to the fact that for the most nights here we would find accomodation on a 34ft catamaran, on the other hand, Elba finds itself just off the Tuscan coast so you could see the pennisula from the island: it offers faintly something to grasp upon, that is, some kind of certainty. In other cases all one sees is the water, in the color of azure, making Elba afloat, and <em>la Corse</em> to the west, one or two clues you could pick up if you put an effort looking for it. Plus just maybe, in the southwest, a silhouette of Sardinia should be there. This is not the end of the world as floating pieces of landmass is remotely within eyesight; yet this <em>is</em> the end of the world as without means nor purposes to cross the water, one gets indeed imprisoned on this island.</p>

<p><em>Oed’ und leer das Meer.</em></p>

<p>Someone named Bonaparte was once imprisoned here, and he surely shared such feeling.</p>

<p>Our host found it quite a surprise that so many German speaking tourists came to Elba in such a season. Maybe it’s the extra vacation this year of 500th anniversary of the religious reformation of Martin Luther, or maybe it’s the last warm days before dwelling into the cold and damp Teutonic winter. And indeed, the presence of tourists in an unexpected periods seems inappropriate and disturbing, the island was just planning to breathe some relief and return to peace.</p>

<p>In the summer sun the island is so stacked with tourists: hotels crowded, villas crowded, sheds and ranches crowded, and even the 5-star-super-luxurious overlooking-the-bay swimming pools are crowded with people holding dishes of reddish lobsters, cups of spakling wines, and watching the beach littered with bright colored sunshades. And here at the moment, there is nothing but the waves caressing the peddle. A cat that seems to be the owner of this beach of Samson, leaping and leading before us from the narrow pathway until the small bank that is pushed up by the sea, and there it sits, after rubbing us on the legs to state its welcoming gesture as lord of Samson beach. With a composed form being the lord, when the other group of tourists came to the beach, the cat also went there to rub them in the legs. Perhaps for a cat this beach, the bay, and the island is big enough to be the world it’d ever live in, however at time the cat also stares beyond the waves, does it also wonder what life would be like on the other side - after all cat is a species overdosed with curiousity and ambition.</p>

<p>Yet again we raced against the sun, quite a thrilling hillclimbing experience as the road is narrow and slippery, however painted golden and magnificent the final on the western slope. On top of the ridge we had our final glimpse of the sun that day, and waved Portoferraio goodbye. In Chinese phrases, ‘red dust’ or ‘red earth’ corresponds to human activities and hence the life of common mortals as opposed to someone withdrawn as the hermit. And here the abundance of such reddish earth that flies in our wheel arches indicates not only the abundance of the element iron in this area, but also intense human activities that came with industry, quite a contrasting experience as we haven’t really yet got out of our meditation treatments from the western part.</p>

<p>It reminds us that two days before when we visited Bagno Vignoni, even the loudiest tourists are muted by Tarkovsky’s bath from the film <em>Nostalgia</em>. Walking alongside the edge becomes almost as sacred as a saviour, protecting the virtual candle as guarding his soul. From then on we’ve already meditated afloat on the water (with the help of a boat of course), and we’ve decided that our love for this world also lies within the most earthly desires: being homesick for instance. We’d travel ruthlessly north, disregarding the smog, the icy roads in Alps, and the pouring rain across the whole Switzerland, which acted as a car washer that cleaned off all the golden Tuscan and ferric Elba dust. Nor would the magnificent cities, the vast fields, the dreaming water, the flickering milky way slow our pace.</p>

<p>Rushing upstairs with bags and trolley cases banging against each other, we broke into the apartment and finally could inhale again the smell of home.<br />
There the leaves of tomates on the shelf waved a little bit, maybe it also misses us.</p>
