<p>We have had left Karlsruhe very early in the morning and hasted southwards as fast as possible to catch the first rays of sunlight right at the feet of those snow-covered summits, at least it was planned as such. In Switzerland traffic jammed along the Autobahn and Herr Giraffe has made a wrong decision to head for Lucerne while the navigation opted for Zurich, effectively prolonging the journey to Italy for another hour. Plus, as daylight falls there is no way the sun shows himself, not on this side of the Alps to say the least, and by the time we reached Lugano on the other side, it was already noon.</p>

<p>Milan and Florence are charming cities however cities do not appeal so much, at least not <em>that</em> much according to Herr Giraffe. Threading through villiages as San Gimignano and Monteriggioni like in Assassin’s Creed the game, we have finally reached the postcard-photo-shooting-position which came quite as a surprise on the side of the regional road: Herr Giraffe was just wondering why there is parking space with a BMW pulled over when he caught a glimpse of the blanc, shiny wall of the chapel of St. Vitaleta as the sun began to dim.</p>

<p>Terrain being solid as it indeed is, with earth either in the shape of dust powders, or ploughed to be fragments in the silhouette of potatoes, clearly owing to the drought, there is however the impression that we are flowing according to the curvature of an immerse setup of waves that expands miles and miles across the heart of Italy. Etruscan artefacts may seem less impressive in the Louvre compared to other brilliance, however positioning himself right here in the cradle of those artefacts, one might just imagine how the curvatures of the earth could have inspired the paintings on the clay and the shape of potteries themselves.</p>

<p>And the earth, who breed these Roman and thence Italians, trembled when Hannibal came with elephants, became their walls, their shrines and chapels, even the whole of a city is shaded in the color of Tuscan earth, and through the sweat and tears of handy people became somewhere in the south, the city of all cities: Rome.</p>

<p>When they prospered with marbles and banking, the people in Siena grew so ambitious. One cathedral planned above one another, a cross over another cross. Today the unfinished pillars and the facade look lonely and abrupt as they break the skylines of Siena. However reaching the skies as their form get fixed in the river of time, the effort itself became unfaded monuments of human endeavour.</p>

<p>Systematic knowledge is preserved as university students learn from the wise words from the books, much better printed than the ones locked in the library inside the Duomo, again those students also hurrdle over artificially set-up problems and discuss to be even more knowledgable. Meanwhile, interestingly, in the kitchens the cooks also pass their secret codes of how to bake a pizza, good enough to serve every customer sitting under the same roof - the tourists, the students, white collar, and blue collar. On and on we got through pottery making, herding, to stone lifting and marble puzzle solving, and even onwards to some computer-assisted organic moledular designing physcist.</p>

<p>How time has passed! And just in front of you what a lively city the immortal time has gifted us.
Or rather it is us, the mortal, who have achieved?</p>
